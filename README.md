Homebranch is a self-hosted web application for managing and reading your E-Book collection.
It provides a user-friendly interface to organize, search, and read your ebooks across devices.

> [!NOTE]
>  The project is split into 3 repositories allowing you to choose the components you want to use:
> - [Homebranch Web](https://github.com/Oghamark/homebranch-web): The frontend web application built with React and TypeScript
> - [Homebranch](https://github.com/Oghamark/homebranch): The backend API built with NestJS and TypeScript
> - [Authentication](https://github.com/Oghamark/Authentication): A standalone authentication service built with NestJS and TypeScript, which can be used with Homebranch or as a general-purpose auth service for other applications

## Features

- Book management with file upload (EPUB) — uploaded files are saved as `Author - Title.epub`
- Automatic metadata enrichment from Open Library (genres, publisher, language, ratings, summary, ISBN, page count)
- Optional Google Books enrichment for series info and any fields Open Library didn't populate
- Bookshelves (collections) with many-to-many book relationships
- Favorites and Currently Reading lists
- Cross-device reading position sync
- User management with roles and permissions
- Pagination and search across the library
- OPDS catalog (v1.2 Atom and v2.0 JSON) for e-reader integration — authenticate with email and password via the companion Auth service
- Automated library scanning — detects new, modified, and removed EPUB files in the uploads directory
- Bidirectional metadata sync: three-way merge between the EPUB file, database, and last-synced snapshot (file wins on conflict); updated database metadata is written back to the EPUB file
- Soft delete when a file is removed; automatically restored when the file is re-added (matched by filename or content hash)
- Book deduplication — admins can scan the library for duplicate EPUB files and resolve each pair
- Background job queues powered by BullMQ and Redis for reliable async processing
- Real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) at `GET /library/events` — notifies connected clients of library changes so they can refetch without polling
- Job history API (`GET /jobs`, `GET /jobs/:id`) with manual scan trigger (`POST /library/scan`) and per-book sync (`POST /library/books/:id/sync`)

## Installation

See our [documentation](https://homebranch.app/docs/getting-started/) for installation and configuration instructions.

---

## OPDS

Homebranch exposes an OPDS catalog for e-readers (KOReader, Thorium, etc.).

| Feed | URL |
|---|---|
| OPDS 1.2 catalog root | `/opds/v1/catalog` |
| OPDS 2.0 catalog root | `/opds/v2/catalog` |
| Authentication document | `/opds/v1/auth` *(public)* |

Authentication uses HTTP Basic Auth (email + password). Credentials are forwarded to the companion Auth service — requires `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` to be configured. Without it, the catalog is accessible but login attempts return `401`.

> **Windows / Docker note:** If Thorium is installed from the Microsoft Store, it runs in an AppContainer sandbox that blocks access to `localhost`. Use your machine's LAN IP address (e.g. `http://192.168.1.x:3000/opds/v1/catalog`) instead.
